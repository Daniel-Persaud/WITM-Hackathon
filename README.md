## Problem
After an increase in crime in Toronto, people need a better way to feel safe during their day to day lives.

## Our Solution
We have created a web app where Torontonians can create live incident/crime reports. This way all users can watch eachothers backs (6ix) and create a safer Toronto.

## Current Functionality
- All users can view all reports posted by other users
- Users can create crime reports
- Users can delete and update crime reports

## Next Steps
- Add various features to our web app such as:
    - Notifactions for when a user may be in a high risk area
    - Specific threat levels for each report and ability to toggle coressponding notifications for each threat level
    - Use machine learning models to predicate crime trends across the city using data gathered from our users and official police data
